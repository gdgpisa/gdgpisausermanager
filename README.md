## Getting Started üõ†

To get starting developing, we really recommend to clone the bot locally and start developing on your machine. 

### Linux
1. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/) with your package manager.
```
Debian
sudo apt install python-2.7
```

2. Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

3. Install [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)
```

pip install python-telegram-bot --upgrade
```
Or you can install from source with
```
git clone https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot --recursive
cd python-telegram-bot
python setup.py install
```

4. Start a chat with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

5. Use the ```/newbot``` command to create a new bot. The BotFather will ask you for a name and username, then generate an authorization token for your new bot.
